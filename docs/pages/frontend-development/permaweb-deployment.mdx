# Permaweb Deployment

The frontend is a Vite React application. It is a single-page application (SPA) that provides a user interface for the backend services.

Deploying the frontend to the Permaweb requires the following steps:

- Own a arns domain.
- Have a wallet with enough AR to deploy the frontend.
- Have a funded ArDrive account to deploy the frontend.

## arNS Domain

You can purchase an arNS domain from the [arns website](https://arns.app/).

## ArDrive Account

You can learn more about how to create an ArDrive account from the [ArDrive documentation](https://docs.ardrive.io/).

## Deploying the Frontend

After building your static frontend, you can deploy it to permaweb by using the provided deploy script.

Learn more about deploying to the Permaweb from the [ArDrive documentation](https://docs.ardrive.io/docs/misc/deploy/deploy.html).

Also, you can learn more about Permaweb deploy here: [https://github.com/permaweb/permaweb-deploy](https://github.com/permaweb/permaweb-deploy)

In order to deploy the frontend to the Permaweb, you need to provide the following environment variables:

- `DEPLOY_KEY`: The key to deploy the frontend. This is the wallet key that owns the arNS domain and has enough AR.

:::warning
Make sure your DEPLOY_KEY contains the wallet encrypted in base64 format.

```bash
base64 -i wallet.json | pbcopy
```

:::

- `ANT_PROCESS`: The ANT process that the frontend will connect to (This is provided by the arNS domain).
- `UNDERNAME`: The undername of the arNS domain that the frontend will be deployed to.

To deploy the frontend to the Permaweb, you need to run the following command:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run frontend:deploy
```

You can now access the frontend using the arNS domain that you own.

:::tip[Handy Tip]
You can use undernames of your arNS domain to deploy multiple environments of the frontend.
