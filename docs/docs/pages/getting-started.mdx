# Getting Started

To get started with the ao-starter-kit, you can run the following command:

:::code-group
```bash [bun]
bun create ao-dapp
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create ao-dapp
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create ao-dapp
```

```bash [npm]
npm init ao-dapp
```
:::


## Project Setup

Running the above command will prompt you to complete multiple steps to set up your project. The steps include:

::::steps
### Enter the name of your project

This will be used as the root directory for your project, relative to the current directory. (eg: my-project)
 
### What should we name the backend process?
 
You can name your backend process anything you like. The name you provide will be used to create the process 
directory and files. (eg: myprocess)

:::warning
Naming your process is important, as it will be used to create the process directory and files. Only valid lua identifier names are allowed.
:::
 
### Pick a process type within myprocess

You can choose from the following process types:
- `lua`: A simple Lua process.
- `teal`: Lua process using the [Teal language](https://github.com/teal-language/tl).

### Select the features you want to include

You can choose from the following features:
- `testing`: Include AO Process Testing suite for your process. [AO Process Testing](https://github.com/Autonomous-Finance/ao-process-testing)
- `squishy`: Tool for combining multiple files into a single one. [Squish](https://github.com/LuaDist/squish)
- `aoform`: Include AO Form for deploying your process. [AOForm](https://github.com/Autonomous-Finance/aoform)

### Pick a frontend framework within my-project

You can choose from the following frontend frameworks:
- `vite-react`: A React application using Vite.

## Project Structure

By selecting all the options, you will have a project structure similar to the following:

```
project-name/             # Your project's root directory.
├── ao/                   # The root directory of your ao processes. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│   └── process-name/          # Process Directory. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       ├── scripts/           # Utility scripts for the process. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       ├── src/               # Source code for the process. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       │   ├── test/                   # Entry point for the process. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       │   │   └── process_test.lua    # Test script for the process. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       │   └── process.lua             # Entry point for the process. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       ├── aoform.yaml        # Configuration for ao-form deployment. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       └── squishy            # Squishy configuration for build. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
├── apps/             # The root directory of your frontend applications. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│   └── frontend/     # React Vite App connected to ao process. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
├── utils             # Directory for utility functions. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│   └── inject-process.ts # Script to inject process Ids from ao to frontend // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
├── node_modules/
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── tsconfig.json
```

This structure includes the following directories:

- `ao/`: The root directory of your ao processes.
- `apps/`: The root directory of your frontend applications.
- `utils/`: Directory for utility functions.

## Preconfigured Scripts

The `package.json` file in the root directory of your project includes the following preconfigured scripts:

- `myprocess:deploy`: Deploys the process using aoform.
- `myprocess:test`: Runs the test script for the process.
- `myprocess:build`: Builds the process using squishy.
- `frontend:dev`: Starts the development server for the frontend application.
- `frontend:build`: Builds the frontend application.


## Next Steps

You can now start developing your ao processes and frontend applications. For more information on how to use the ao-starter-kit, follow along with the rest of the documentation. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to reach out to us on dedicated channels.
