# Permaweb Deployment

The frontend is a Vite React application. It is a single-page application (SPA) that provides a user interface for the backend services.

Deploying the frontend to the Permaweb requires the following steps:

- Own a arns domain.
- Have a wallet with enough AR to deploy the frontend.
- Have a funded Irys node to deploy the frontend.

## arNS Domain
You can purchase an arNS domain from the [arns website](https://arns.app/).

## Irys Node

You can learn more about how Irys works and how to set up an Irys node in the [Irys documentation](https://arweave-tools.irys.xyz/overview/about).

## Deploying the Frontend

In order to deploy the frontend to the Permaweb, you need to provide the following environment variables:

- `DEPLOY_KEY`: The key to deploy the frontend. This is the wallet key that owns the arNS domain and has enough AR in the Irys node.
- `ANT_PROCESS`: The ANT process that the frontend will connect to (This is provided by the arNS domain).
- `DEPLOY_WALLET`: The wallet address of the DEPLOY_KEY

To deploy the frontend to the Permaweb, you need to run the following command:

```bash [Terminal]
cd apps/frontend && node ./scripts/permaweb-deploy.js
```

This command will pack the frontend and deploy it to the Permaweb using the Irys node.

You can now access the frontend using the arNS domain that you own.

:::tip[Handy Tip]
You can use undernames of your arNS domain to deploy multiple environments of the frontend.
