# Building the frontend

The frontend is a Vite React application. It is a single-page application (SPA) that provides a user interface for the backend services.

Building the vite frontend is a simple process. You can learn more about building in the official Vite documentation [here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html).

To build the frontend, run the following command:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run frontend:build
```

You can deploy your frontend to a static hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

Wouldn't it be awesome if your frontend could be deployed to the Permaweb? You can do that with permaweb deployment tool that Ao Starter Kit provides.
