# Building the process using amalg.lua

This section will guide you through the process of building the process. The process is built using the `build` script in the `process` directory. The `build` script is a simple shell script that uses the `amalg.lua` script to build the process.

:::info 
Deploying a Lua application that is split among multiple modules is a challenge. A tool that can package a Lua script and its modules into a single file is a valuable help. This is such a tool.

## Configuring build script

Create AO dApp provides a script to build the process using `amalg.lua`. The configuration for `amalg.lua` is stored in the `scripts/build.sh` file in the process directory.

The configuration specifies the entry point for the process, the modules to include, the minify level, and the output file.

## Building the Process

To build the process, run the following command in the process directory:

```bash [Terminal]
cd ao/process-name && ./scripts/build.sh
```

:::tip[Handy Tip]
Create Ao dApp provides a script to build the process from the root of the project. You can run the following command to build the process:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run myprocess:build
```
