# Building the process

This section will guide you through the process of building the process. The process is built using the `build` script in the `process` directory. The `build` script is a simple shell script that uses the `docker` command to build the process.

:::info 
Building processes is done using Squish via Docker. Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.

## Configuring Squish

Squish is a tool for combining multiple files into a single one. It is used to build the process into a single file. The configuration for Squish is stored in the `squishy` file in the process directory.

The basic configuration for Squish is as follows:

```lua [./ao/my-process/squishy]
Main "src/process.lua"

Module "process_lib" "./src/process_lib.lua"

Option "minify-level" "none"
Output 'build/process.lua'
```

The configuration specifies the entry point for the process, the modules to include, the minify level, and the output file.

## Building the Process

To build the process, run the following command in the process directory:

```bash [Terminal]
cd ao/process-name && ./scripts/build.sh
```

:::tip[Handy Tip]
Ao Starter Kit provides a script to build the process from the root of the project. You can run the following command to build the process:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run myprocess:build
```
