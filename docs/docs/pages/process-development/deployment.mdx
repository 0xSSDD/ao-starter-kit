# Process deployment [using aoform]

This section will guide you through the process of deploying the process using `aoform`. `aoform` is a tool for deploying AO processes to the AO Network. The configuration for `aoform` is stored in the `aoform.yaml` file in the process directory.

:::info
Deploying processes is done using `aoform`. Ensure you have `aoform` installed on your project.

## Configuring AOForm

The `aoform.yaml` file in the process directory contains the configuration for deploying the process using `aoform`. The basic configuration for `aoform` is as follows:

```yaml [./ao/my-process/aoform.yaml]
## AoForm Configuration
## This file is used to configure the AoForm package
## For more information, visit

- name: my-process
  file: build/process.lua
  prerun: ./src/reset_modules.lua
  scheduler: _GQ33BkPtZrqxA84vM8Zk-N2aO0toNNu_C-l-rawrBA
  module: GYrbbe0VbHim_7Hi6zrOpHQXrSQz07XNtwCnfbFo2I0
  tags:
    - name: Name
      value: my-process
```

The configuration specifies the name of the process, the entry point for the process, the prerun script, the scheduler, the module, and the tags for the process.

## Deploying the Process

To deploy the process, run the following command in the process directory:

```bash [Terminal]
# Export the wallet JSON
export WALLET_JSON="$(cat ~/.aos.json)"

# Deploy the process
cd ao/process-name && npx aoform deploy
```

:::tip[Handy Tip]
Ao Starter Kit provides a script to deploy the process from the root of the project. You can run the following command to deploy the process:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run myprocess:deploy
```
