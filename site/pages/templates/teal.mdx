# Teal Typed Template

This template provides a starting point for building applications with Teal, a typed dialect of Lua. Teal combines the simplicity and performance of Lua with static typing, offering improved code safety and tooling support. It compiles directly to Lua, allowing seamless integration with existing Lua codebases and libraries. This template includes a basic Teal process demonstrating counter functionality, showcasing how to leverage Teal's features in an AO environment.

```

### Build the Lua process

:::warning
You need to make the `./ao/process-name/scripts/build.sh` executable before running the build command.
:::

```bash
chmod +x ./ao/process-name/scripts/build.sh

npm run process-name:build
```

### Deploy the Lua process

:::warning
You need to make the `./ao/process-name/scripts/deploy.sh` executable before running the deploy command.
:::

```bash
chmod +x ./ao/process-name/scripts/deploy.sh

npm run process-name:deploy
```

### Inject the process id into the frontend app

```bash
npm run process-name:inject
```

### Run the frontend app

```bash
npm run frontend:dev
```

:::tip
You can also deploy the frontend to permaweb using the steps on the [Permaweb Deployment](/frontend-development/permaweb-deployment)
