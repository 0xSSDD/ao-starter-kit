## How to build, deploy and run

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build the Lua process

:::warning
You need to make the `./ao/process-name/scripts/build.sh` executable before running the build command.
:::

```bash
chmod +x ./ao/process-name/scripts/build.sh

npm run process-name:build
```

### Deploy the Lua process

:::warning
You need to make the `./ao/process-name/scripts/deploy.sh` executable before running the deploy command.
:::

```bash
chmod +x ./ao/process-name/scripts/deploy.sh

npm run process-name:deploy
```

### Inject the process id into the frontend app

```bash
npm run process-name:inject
```

### Run the frontend app
Before running the frontend app you need edit app src and replace the proces in the import statements and it's usage across the components.

eg:
```typescript [./frontend/src/App.tsx]
// Replace
import { COUNTER } from "./constants/counter_process";

// with
import { MYPROCESS } from "./constants/myprocess_process";
```

```bash
npm run frontend:dev
```

:::tip
You can also deploy the frontend to permaweb using the steps on the [Permaweb Deployment](/frontend-development/permaweb-deployment)
