## Project Structure

By selecting all the options, you will have a project structure similar to the following:

```
project-name/             # Your project's root directory.
├── ao/                   # The root directory of your ao processes. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│   └── process-name/          # Process Directory. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       ├── scripts/           # Utility scripts for the process. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       ├── src/               # Source code for the process. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       │   ├── test/                   # Entry point for the process. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       │   │   └── process_test.lua    # Test script for the process. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       │   └── process.lua             # Entry point for the process. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│       └── aoform.yaml        # Configuration for ao-form deployment. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
├── apps/             # The root directory of your frontend applications. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│   └── frontend/     # React Vite App connected to ao process. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
├── utils             # Directory for utility functions. // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
│   └── inject-process.js # Script to inject process Ids from ao to frontend // [!code hl] // [!code focus]
├── node_modules/
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── tsconfig.json
```

This structure includes the following directories:

- `ao/`: The root directory of your ao processes.
- `apps/`: The root directory of your frontend applications.
- `utils/`: Directory for utility functions.

## Preconfigured Scripts

The `package.json` file in the root directory of your project includes the following preconfigured scripts:

- `myprocess:deploy`: Deploys the process using aoform.
- `myprocess:test`: Runs the test script for the process.
- `myprocess:build`: Builds the process using squishy.
- `myprocess:inject`: Injects the deployed processes Ids from ao to the frontend.
- `frontend:dev`: Starts the development server for the frontend application.
- `frontend:build`: Builds the frontend application.
