# Frontend Development

The provided frontend is a Vite React application. It is a single-page application (SPA) that provides a user interface for the backend services. The frontend is built using the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Extra libraries used in the frontend that we recommend you use:
- [Permaweb AoConnect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@permaweb/aoconnect)
- [Arweave Wallet Kit](https://github.com/labscommunity/arweave-wallet-kit)
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)

:::tip[Handy Tip]
TanStack Query is a powerful and flexible data fetching library for React. It is highly recommended to use TanStack Query for data fetching in your frontend. This will enable caching, pagination, and other features out of the box.
